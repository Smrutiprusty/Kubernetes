A single host running multiple containers using the Docker Engine.
Containers are lightweight, isolated environments for running applications.
Best suited for local development, CI/CD, or simple containerized environments.
# Kubernetes
Definition: Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform for managing, scaling, and deploying containerized applications in distributed environments.
Shown on the right:
A Master Node manages the cluster (with API Server, Scheduler, etcd, and Controller Manager).
Multiple Worker Nodes run containers within Pods.
Features include auto-scaling, self-healing, and advanced networking.
Suitable for production-level deployments across multiple nodes.
